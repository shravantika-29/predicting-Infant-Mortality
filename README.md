<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Despite progress in reducing infant mortality rates globally, challenges persist, particularly in vulnerable regions. Addressing the underlying causes of neonatal deaths and improving healthcare access are critical for further reductions in infant mortality. Continued monitoring and targeted interventions are essential to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for child health by 2030</p>
<h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
<ul><li>Find the significant factors  which influence Infant Mortality</li>
<li>Build a most accurate machine learning model for Infant Mortality</li></ul>
<br><strong>Key highlights:</strong>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Performed various Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and compare the variables.
<li>Features were selected based on the statistical significance test</li>
<li>Experimented with different Machine Learning algorithms: Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, KNN, Bagging, and Boosting.
<li>Compared the results to recommend the best Machine Learning model.
</ul>
