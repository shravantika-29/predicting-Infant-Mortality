Predicting-Infant-Mortality
This is a college final semester project completed under the guidance of United Network of Professionals(UNP) Team.

About:

INTRODUCTION
Despite progress in reducing infant mortality rates globally, challenges persist, particularly in vulnerable regions. Addressing the underlying causes of neonatal deaths and improving healthcare access are critical for further reductions in infant mortality. Continued monitoring and targeted interventions are essential to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for child health by 2030

OBJECTIVE
Find the significant factors which influence Infant Mortality
Build a most accurate machine learning model for Infant Mortality

Key highlights:
Performed various Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and compare the variables.
Features were selected based on the statistical significance test
Experimented with different Machine Learning algorithms Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, KNN, Bagging, and Boosting.
Compared the results to recommend the best Machine Learning model.
